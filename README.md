## Short Description:
A fully responsive personal portfolio website that showcases my CV, projects, and contact information. <br>
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
**JavaScript code Explination:** <br>
- Image Viewer: <br>
- The modal functionality portion of the code enables all the images on the website to be interactive and enlarge when clicked. <br>
- The modal is hidden when the user clicks outside the image or on the close button (black X) at the top right side of the image. <br>
<br> 

Animated Particle Backround: <br>
- Created a interactive backround animation of differnt sized glowing particles that slowly drift around and respond to cursor presence. <br>
- The particles make use of the inverse square law causeing them to move away from the cursor when near. <br>
- The particles also include a colour gradient that changes horizontally across the screen to match that of the banner. <br>
<br>

**CSS code explination:** <br>
- A smooth scrool behaviour was used when selecting any of the subheadings within the banner, causeing a smooth scrool down to the reevant sub heading (About me, Projects, Skills, ect.) <br>
- Base fonts were set as "Montserrat" and "Playfiar Display", this also correlated well with the font styles in my CV. <br>
- A canvas backround layer was used for the particle animations and was styles to sit behinnd all content of the page by makeing use of z-index:0. <br>
- The header design makes use of a linear gradient from a soft purple to a soft green for visually pleasing affects, whithin the header code characters were added for asthetics. <br>
